# Ghost

Ghost is a free, open, simple blogging platform that's available to anyone who
wants to use it. Lovingly created and maintained by [John
O'Nolan](http://twitter.com/JohnONolan) + [Hannah
Wolfe](http://twitter.com/ErisDS) + an amazing group of
[contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors). 

## Usage

Ghost is already installed and running, simply visit the following address:

  [@@vmDomain@@:2368](@@vmDomain@@:2368)

## Logging in For The First Time

Once you have the Ghost server up and running, you should be able to navigate to
[@@vmDomain@@:2368](@@vmDomain@@:2368) from a web browser, where you will be
prompted for a login.

1.  Click on the "register new user" link
2.  Enter your user details (careful here: There is no password reset yet!)
3.  Return to the login screen and use those details to log in.

Note - this is still very alpha. Not everything works yet.
